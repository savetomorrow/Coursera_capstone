Where to rent in Singapore?\n\n## Business problem\n\nThrough this project, I will identify the optimal rental location in Singapore for someone looking for an apartment, based on price and proximity to places of interest (in particular food venues, which are very important). I will analyse specific neighbourhoods using the Foursquare API. \n\nAlthough it is a small nation-state, Singapore is a very expensive place to live in, with small apartments going for millions of dollars. Apartments for rent are also expensive, even in the short term. This project is thus important to help renters find the best value for money rental.\n\nThe target audience is short-term renters, e.g. people who have moved here for work. The goal is to recommend an optimal housing location to rent.\n\n## Data required\n\nI will using the following data sources: \n* Singapore towns and median residential rental prices (available from Singapore government open dataset https://data.gov.sg/dataset/b35046dc-7428-4cff-968d-ef4c3e9e6c99) \n* Singapore town locations using Google Maps API\n* Singapore food venue recommendations using Foursquare API (limited to 50 queries per day)\n\nThese will help us to analyse important factors like price and proximity to good food, to determine the best rental location."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
